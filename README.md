# Deception Perception

----
Project Description
----
This is a six-week project from the entrepreneurship class from Master's in Data Science at University of San Francisco. I and other seven students are the founding members of this startup we built from scratch, and we presented our idea and the initial product (web-based full stack machine learning application) to  venture capitalists at the end of the sixth week.

Our startup is called Deception Perception.

Deception Perception is a lie detector for litigation purposes. Being able to detect deception may be the difference between life and death in the legal space. Our project aims to aid lawyers and law enforcement in prioritizing which suspects to examine first based on their (deceptive) statements. Powered by our deep learning model, Deception Perception not only detects true statement vs. false statement, but also outputs the model's confidence and the top five words from the original statement to make that decision.
